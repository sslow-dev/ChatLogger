  -  Date/time
  -  Chatter's relation to user (teammate/opponent/spectator/etc.)
  -  Chatter's platform (PlayStation/Xbox/Steam/Epic/etc.)
    
- Option to minify JSON files

## Usage

Chats will be stored in the `Chat Logs` folder inside your BakkesMod `data` folder

### Toggle saving chats

  - If you happen to enable `Save chats` mid-match, this has the added benefit of also saving any chats that were sent *before* you toggled the setting (no chats are lost)
  - Enabling `Clear chats` effectively turns the plugin off, but you still keep the above benefit
